<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a small applet for the management of the WPS classes.<br>
This program should be used only by advanced OS/2 - eCS users, aware
of the consequences of registering/deregistering WPS classes.
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2">
<h2><a name="Installation"></a>Installation</h2>
<p>The application consists in an executable file, this documentation file and
a REXX installation script.<br>
To install the program, unzip the archive in directory of your choice and
double click on the install.cmd icon to create a program object in your
Desktop\Programs\Utilities folder.<br>
If the Utilities folder is not found the object will be created either
in your Programs folder or in your Desktop folder.
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2">
<h2><a name="Features_and_settings"></a>Features</h2>
<p>This program allows:
<ul>
<li>to register new WPS classes,
<li>to deregister existing WPS classes,
<li>to deregister not-deregistrable WPS classes, by directly removing
them from the OS2SYS.INI data,
<li>to modify the path or the name of the DLLs associated with a WPS class name.
</ul>
The program consists in just one dialog window presenting the list of the
currently registered WPS classes sorted alphabetically.<br>
The list is divided in two columns. On the left there is the WPS class name,
on the right the name of the DLL containing its definition.
<p>
The <b>Refresh</b> button makes the program re-scan the WPS class list
data updating the window content.<br>
When an item in the list is selected the <i>Edit&nbsp;</i>, the <i>Deregister&nbsp;</i>
and the <i>Remove&nbsp;</i> buttons are enabled.
<p>
The <b>Edit</b> button allows to change the name or the path of the DLL
containing the definition of the currently selected class.<br>
Once you click on <i>Edit&nbsp;</i> (or <b>double click</b> on a class item in
the list window) the data of the selected class is written in the
<i>Class name&nbsp;</i> and the <i>Module name&nbsp;</i> entry fields.<br>
After having modified the content of the <i>Module name&nbsp;</i> entry field
you must click on the <b>Apply</b> button to update the module data.<br>
You can click any time on the <b>Cancel</b> button to exit
<i>Edit mode&nbsp;</i> and leave the class data unmodified.
<p>
To <b>register an new WPS class</b> enter the class name and the name
of the DLL containing the class definition in the entry fields, click
on the <b>Add</b> button and on the <i>Ok&nbsp;</i> button in the
confirmation dialog which will as a consequence pop up.
<p>
To <b>deregister the selected WPS class</b> click on the <b>Deregister</b>
button. A confirmation dialog will ask you to confirm the deregistration.<br>
If the current class cannot be deregistered via the standard
<i>WinDeregisterObjectClass&nbsp;</i> API, you can still deregister
it via the <b>Remove</b> button which works at a lower level
and allows to remove even the underegistrable classes.

<h2><a name="Planned_features"></a>Planned features</h2>
<p>Depending on the user requests (and will to pay for the needed
development costs) I might add the following features:
<ul>
<li>ability to work on OS/2 - eCS installations residing on accessible drives
(i.e. not the current OS installation),
<li>backup/restore current class data,
<li>view the class list sorting by class, dll name and registration order,
<li>automatic deregistration of all classes contained in a given dll
with optional deletion of the dll files,
<li>destruction of all abstract objects of a given class (and their
data stored in the INI files),
<li>other features according to user requests.
</ul>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2">
<h2><a name="Registration"></a>Registration</h2>
<p>In this stage of development, no program registration is needed.<br>
You are free to use this version of the program until a new version is available.<br>
